This repository contains my practice files and exercises for mastering NumPy, the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. A deep understanding of NumPy is essential for any serious work in data science, machine learning, and AI, as it provides the high-performance, multi-dimensional array object that underpins almost the entire ecosystem.

The scripts and notebooks here are my hands-on work in learning to perform efficient numerical operations on large datasets.

## üéØ Core NumPy Concepts Covered

This collection demonstrates my practical experience with the core features of the NumPy library, including:

-   **The `ndarray` Object:**
    -   Creating N-dimensional arrays from scratch (`np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.arange`).
    -   Understanding array attributes (`.shape`, `.dtype`, `.ndim`).
-   **Indexing & Slicing:**
    -   Advanced indexing techniques for accessing and modifying array subsections.
    -   Boolean array indexing for filtering data.
-   **Array Manipulation & Operations:**
    -   Reshaping, stacking, and splitting arrays.
    -   Performing fast, element-wise arithmetic operations.
-   **Broadcasting:**
    -   Understanding and applying the rules of broadcasting to perform operations on arrays of different shapes.
-   **Universal Functions (ufuncs):**
    -   Applying mathematical functions (`np.sqrt`, `np.exp`, `np.sin`) across entire arrays without explicit loops.
-   **Basic Linear Algebra & Statistics:**
    -   Matrix multiplication (`@` operator).
    -   Calculating aggregates like mean, median, sum, and standard deviation.

## üìö My Learning Pathway

This repository is a core component of my self-directed curriculum.

-   **Step 1:** Python Foundations
-   ‚û°Ô∏è **Step 2: Data Analysis with `Pandas` & `NumPy` (You are here)**
-   **Step 3:** Data Visualization with `Matplotlib`
-   **Step 4:** Computer Vision with `OpenCV`

Feel free to explore the files to see my implementation of these fundamental scientific computing concepts.
